    "1. An Azure AI Foundry project\n",
    "2. A deployed model (e.g., gpt-4o-mini)\n",

    "- Better integration with Azure AI Foundry projects\n",
    "- Simplified authentication using connection strings\n",

      "Async Response: Asynchronous programming offers several benefits, especially in applications that require handling multiple tasks or I/O operations efficiently. Here are the main advantages:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Improved Responsiveness**  \n",
      "   Asynchronous code allows a program to perform other tasks while waiting for operations (like file I/O or network requests) to complete. This keeps user interfaces (UIs) and services responsive and prevents blocking.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Efficient Resource Utilization**  \n",
      "   Asynchronous operations free up system resources by not blocking threads during wait times. This allows a single thread to manage multiple I/O-bound operations, reducing the need for many threads and saving memory and CPU.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Scalability**  \n",
      "   Asynchronous programming enables applications (especially servers) to handle many concurrent connections or operations efficiently. For example, asynchronous web servers can serve thousands of clients without requiring a separate thread per client.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Better Throughput**  \n",
      "   By not blocking on slow operations, asynchronous apps can achieve higher throughput, as they can start new tasks instead of waiting for others to finish.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Reduced Latency**  \n",
      "   Time-consuming operations do not block the entire application. Instead, the app can continue processing other tasks, reducing perceived delays for users.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Simpler Error Handling (in modern frameworks)**  \n",
      "   Async/await constructs (in languages like JavaScript, Python, and C#) make asynchronous code easier to write and understand, also enabling straightforward error propagation and handling.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Typical Use Cases:**\n",
      "- Web servers and network applications\n",
      "- File and database operations\n",
      "- Real-time applications (chats, games, etc.)\n",
      "- User interfaces that should remain responsive\n",
      "\n",
      "**Summary:**  \n",
      "Asynchronous programming enables efficient, scalable, and responsive applications by allowing code to initiate and manage multiple operations without waiting for each to finish before starting the next.\n",
