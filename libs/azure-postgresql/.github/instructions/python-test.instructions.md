Follow the general [coding guidelines](../copilot-instructions.md) for this
project.

When making changes to the Python source code, ensure that you:

- Have both async and sync versions of the code where applicable,
- Propose writing tests for any new functionality or bug fixes,
- Propose running all tests and ensure they pass before submitting changes, and,
- Give a brief summary of your workflow in the end.
